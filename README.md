# An App to Visualize Your GitHub Events Filtered by Your Favorite Language

## Motivation
GitHub feed is a great way for you to get updated with what's trending in the community. You can discover some useful repositories by looking at what your connections star.

However, there might be some repositories you don't care about. For example, you might be only interested in Python repositories while there are repositories written in other languages. Thus, it takes you a while to find interesting libraries.

Wouldn't it be nice if you can create a personal dashboard showing the repositories that your connections followed filtered by your favorite language? 

This repository allows you to do exactly that.
